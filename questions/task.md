Second: Write queries that directly answer predetermined questions from a business stakeholder

Write SQL queries against your new structured relational data model that answer at least two of the following bullet points below of your choosing. Commit them to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise.

Note: When creating your data model be mindful of the other requests being made by the business stakeholder. If you can capture more than two bullet points in your model while keeping it clean, efficient, and performant, that benefits you as well as your team.
