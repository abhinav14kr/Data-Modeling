## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a structured data model for Fetchm. The data includes information about users, brands, and receipts with complex nested structures. More about the assignment can be seen in this link, 

https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/analytics-engineer/ineeddata-data-modeling/data-modeling.html

## Data Sources

- **brands.json**: Contains brand information including IDs, names, categories, and CPG references
- **receipts.json**: Contains receipt data with nested line items, rewards information, and user references
- **users.json**: Contains user account information and metadata

## Data Modeling Approach

The repository demonstrates a multi-layered data modeling approach:

1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: Scripts in the `data-ingestion` folder handle the loading of raw JSON data into Snowflake stage
2. **Data Modeling**: SQL scripts in the `data-modeling` folder transform nested JSON into structured relational tables
3. **Data Quality**: Scripts in the `data-quality-issue` folder identify data quality issues
4. **Analytics**: The `questions` folder contains analytical queries that leverage the structured data model

## Key Features

- Normalization of nested JSON structures into relational tables
- Handling of complex one-to-many relationships
- Optimized storage with proper primary and foreign key relationships
- Data quality review, stakeholder communication 

## Getting Started

1. Review the Entity Relationship Diagram (`erd.jpg`) to understand the data model
2. Execute the ingestion scripts in the `data-ingestion` folder to load raw data
3. Run the modeling scripts in the `data-modeling` folder to create structured tables
4. Use the analytics queries in the `questions` folder to extract business insights
